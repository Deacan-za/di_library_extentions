### What is this repository for? ###

When writting libraries that are going to be consumed by other api's. How do we go about providing a
simple way of registering the required dependencies for the user in their APIs? How do we provided the 
ability for the user to provided the required configuration into the library?

This repo will provide examples for

- Unity
- Microsoft's built in IServiceCollection
- Alternative for when you have written a library
  that will only be consumed by your own API and you don't
  want to expose the DI container into your library. 

This repo will serve as example code for an upcoming article.
